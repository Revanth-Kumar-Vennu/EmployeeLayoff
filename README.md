# EmployeeLayoffPrediction
An organizations financial status indicates, whether the organization have to
undergo any cutoff in their employee strength or not. A company with good
profits, generally grow by adding more employees, where as companies running
under losses, have to undergo layoffs. Organizations financial status depends on
factors like total revenue, total expenditure, profit and number of satisfied
customers. These factors can be grouped under two indexed category deals with
financial index including the relevant finance related factors. Delivery index
comes under second category. Good delivery index leads to more satisfied
customers, who are likely to give more business to the company. The project
aims at employee layoff prediction using sigmoid neural net. The project
comprises of four modules. The first module deals with adding the companies
financial details and delivery index details . The second module deals with
creating the comma separated value data file from the existing data in the DB.
The third module deals with plotting the sigmoid function and adjusting the
weights. The final module deals with predicting the occurrence of layoffs. A
back propagation neural net with sigmoid function is used in this project.
Backpropagation algorithms are a family of methods used to efficiently train
artificial neural networks (ANNs) following a gradient descent approach. The
main feature of back propagation is its iterative, recursive and efficient method
for calculating the weights updates to improve in the network until it is able to
perform the task for which it is being trained. Backpropagation requires the
derivatives of activation functions to be known at network design time.
Automatic differentiation is a technique that can automatically and analytically
provide the derivatives to the training algorithm.
